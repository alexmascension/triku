    The next step is to remove genes with high entropy. This high entropy can be considered as 1 or > 0.9X. In order
    to do that we first need to do a clustering on the dataset. Although the clustering biases the genes that will be
    removed, this part is quite robust, because the genes that we expect to remove have a low expression, and they do 
    not arrive to the minimum required expression. In that case, unless the clustering is really specific, those genes
    should always be removed.
    In order not to remove genes with local expression patterns, we will perform clustering with a high number of 
    clusters. We will choose a resolution for leiden of ~ 1.2, which produces a considerable number of clusters, and
    we have seen that works good for what we are looking for.

    '''
    Once clusters are obtained, we calculate the proportion of non-zero expressing cells per clusters and per gene.
    With that, we obtain a histogram of proportions that we will use to establish a cut-off proportion, that is, 
    clusters with fewer expressing cells than the proportion (for each gene) will not be considered for entropy 
    calculation. This part is calculated inside entropy_per_gene.
    Finally, we will get the dictionary dict_entropy_genes, with the entropy of each gene, dict_proportions_genes,
    with the proportions of counts per gene, and dict_percentage_counts_genes, with the proportion of cells with
    positive expression per gene.
