    """
    This function calls the triku method using python directly. This function expects an
    annData object or a csv / txt matrix of n_cells x n_genes. The function then returns an array / list
    of the selected genes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    object_triku : scanpy.AnnData or pandas.DataFrame
        Object with count matrix. If `pandas.DataFrame`, rows are cells and columns are genes.
    n_features : int
        Number of features to select. If None, the number is chosen automatically.
    use_raw : bool
        If True, selects the adata.raw, if it exists.
        To set the .raw propety, set as: adata.raw = adata.
        This matrix is adjusted to select the genes and cells that
        appear in the current adata. E.g. if we are running triku with a subpopulation, triku will select the cells
        from adata.raw of that subpopulation. If certain genes have been removed after saving the raw, triku will not
        consider the removed genes.
    n_divisions : int, None
        If the array of counts is not integer, number of bins in which each unit will be divided to account for
        that effect. For example, if n_divisions is 10, then 0.12 and 0.13 would be in the same bin, and 0.12 and 0.34
        in two different bins. If n_divisions is 2, the two cases would be in the same bin.
        The higher the number of divisions the more precise the calculation of distances will be. It will be more
        time consuming, though. If n_divisions is None, we will adjust it automatically.
    s : float
        Correction factor for automatic feature selection. Negative values imply a selction of more genes, and
        positive values imply a selection of fewer genes. We recommend values between -0.1 and 0.1.
    n_windows : int
        Number of windows used for median subtraction of Wasserstein distance.
    min_knn : int
        minimum number of expressed cells based on the knn to apply the convolution. If a gene has less than min_knn
        expressing cells, Wasserstein distance is set to 0, and the convolution is set as the knn expression.
    name: str
        Name of the run. If None, stores results in "triku_X". Else, stores it in "triku_X_{name}".
    verbose : str ['debug', 'triku', 'info', 'warning', 'error', 'critical']
        Logger verbosity output.
    Returns
    -------
    list_features : list
        list of selected features
