Triku (hedgehog in euskera) is a feature selection method prepared for Single Cell Analysis.
Triku has been prepared to work with `scanpy <https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_
``annData`` objects directly.

You can visit the notebooks at out `notebook repo <https://github.com/alexmascension/triku_notebooks>`_

How do I use triku?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We suppose you are going to run triku using scanpy. To use triku, simply
import it and run it in one line::

   import triku as tk

   tk.tl.triku(adata)

After that, you can find which features are selected with ``adata.var['highly_variable']``.
The scores for each gene are located in ``adata.var['triku_distance']``.
The higher the score, the better.

If you are using scanpy, you **must** run triku before running ``sc.pp.pca`` and
``sc.pp.neighbors``. We recommend running these commands with the following settings::

   import scanpy as sc

   sc.pp.pca(adata)
   sc.pp.neighbors(adata, metric='cosine', n_neighbors=int(0.5 * len(adata) ** 0.5))

After you have run triku, you **need to rerun** neighbors using the set of selected features. This doesn't take much time, though.::

   sc.pp.pca(adata)
   sc.pp.neighbors(adata, metric='cosine', n_neighbors=int(0.5 * len(adata) ** 0.5))

   tk.tl.triku(adata)

   sc.pp.neighbors(adata, metric='cosine', n_neighbors=int(0.5 * len(adata) ** 0.5), use_rep="X_triku")


In some cases (a high number of features is selected or the dataset is too large) you may need to run PCA first and then neighbors.::
   
   sc.pp.pca(adata)
   sc.pp.neighbors(adata, metric='cosine', n_neighbors=int(0.5 * len(adata) ** 0.5))

   tk.tl.triku(adata)

   sc.pp.pca(adata)
   sc.pp.neighbors(adata, metric='cosine', n_neighbors=int(0.5 * len(adata) ** 0.5))


This may seem repetitive üôÉ, but consider that the first PCA/kNN run is to set the ground for triku to work. Then, with the correct selection of features, 
PCA/neighbors yield the results with the *best* features. 

**Note that** for the PCA/neighbors combination you don't need to specify ``use_rep="X_triku"`` because PCA already chooses the selected features from ``adata.var['highly_variable']``. 
If you run ``neighbors`` alone, you must specify ``use_rep="X_triku"`` because otherwise it will select ``adata.X['X_pca']`` from the first run! 

You can run triku with raw or log-transformed count matrices. Scores tend to be better
in log-transformed matrices, although the results depend on the dataset.
